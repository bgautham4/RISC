# RISC_V ASM for queue data structure
# C code for BFS.
Create the executable file by running `<CC> test.c trees.c -o output_file`. Where `CC` is a C compiler.
The RISC_V ASM code of the queue can be run on the [RIPES](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) simulator to understand the memory layout of a queue data structure.
